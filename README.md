jam-2014
========
This is a directory for my project for the Global Game Jam 2014, Fatigue.

It was made in under 48 hours, solely by me.

To compile, use pygame with python 2.7 and use r.py to generate an exe and build (including assets).
You will need py2exe to do this. Or you could run it from IDLE.
